# TypicalAppKoin

A demonstration Android application showcasing API integration using Ktor for networking and Koin for dependency injection, built with XML for UI layouts.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a practical example of how to build a modern Android application using a specific stack of technologies. It focuses on:

*   **Networking with Ktor:** Making API calls to a remote server (you can specify which API if you have one in mind, e.g., fetching posts, products, etc.).
*   **Dependency Injection with Koin:** Managing dependencies throughout the application in a clean and testable way.
*   **Traditional XML Layouts:** Demonstrating UI construction using Android's XML-based layout system.
*   **[Optional: Add other key features, e.g., MVVM architecture, LiveData/Flow, Coroutines for asynchronous operations]**

## Features

*   Fetches data from a remote API (e.g., list of posts, user details - *be specific if possible*).
*   Displays the fetched data in a user-friendly way (e.g., RecyclerView).
*   Demonstrates proper setup and usage of Ktor for network requests.
*   Illustrates how to configure Koin modules for providing dependencies.
*   [Add more features as your app develops, e.g., Error handling for API calls, Loading states, Basic UI navigation]

## Tech Stack & Key Libraries

*   **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**: Primary programming language.
*   **[Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-overview.html)**: For making HTTP requests to APIs.
    *   Content Negotiation (e.g., `ktor-client-content-negotiation` with `ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json`)
    *   [Specify other Ktor features used, e.g., Logging, CIO engine]
*   **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)**: For dependency injection.
*   **Android Jetpack:**
    *   **ViewModel**: To store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    *   **LiveData/StateFlow**: For observing data changes.
    *   **[Add others like Navigation Component, Room if used]**
*   **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)**: For managing background threads and asynchronous operations.
*   **XML Layouts**: For defining the user interface.
*   **[Material Components for Android](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started)**: For modern UI elements (if used).
*   **[Add any other important libraries, e.g., Coil/Glide for image loading, Retrofit (if you decide to switch later, unlikely given the project name)]**
