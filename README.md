# TypicalAppKoin

A demonstration Android application showcasing API integration using Ktor for networking and Koin for dependency injection, built with XML for UI layouts.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a practical example of how to build a modern Android application using a specific stack of technologies. It focuses on:

*   **Networking with Ktor:** Making API calls to a remote server.
*   **Dependency Injection with Koin:** Managing dependencies throughout the application in a clean and testable way.
*   **Traditional XML Layouts:** Demonstrating UI construction using Android's XML-based layout system.

## Features

*   Fetches data from a remote API (e.g., list of posts, user details - *be specific if possible*).
*   Displays the fetched data in a user-friendly way (e.g., RecyclerView).
*   Demonstrates proper setup and usage of Ktor for network requests.
*   Illustrates how to configure Koin modules for providing dependencies.

## Tech Stack & Key Libraries

*   **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**: Primary programming language.
*   **[Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-overview.html)**: For making HTTP requests to APIs.
    *   Content Negotiation (e.g., `ktor-client-content-negotiation` with `ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json`)
    *   [Specify other Ktor features used, e.g., Logging, CIO engine]
*   **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)**: For dependency injection.
*   **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)**: For managing background threads and asynchronous operations.
*   **XML Layouts**: For defining the user interface.
*   **[Material Components for Android](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started)**: For modern UI elements (if used).
